# Connect to a server

Use a web browser to connect to a Tape server.

## Use a web browser

To connect to a Tape server through a web browser, enter the desired server address in the browser's address bar such as `https://tape.build.pm`.

After entering a valid Tape server address, the [Sign Up](#sign-up-registering-an-account) and [Sign In](#sign-in) page appears. Enter your credentials to log in or register to become a member of that server.

# Sign Up registering an account

To access any Tape server, register an account manually. After successfully registering, you can [sign in](#sign-in) to the server.

## Manual registration

You can create an account by providing your:

- [Username](#choosing-a-username-and-display-name) or login
- Email
- Password

A server can ask for you to verify your email, this can be done by simply clicking on the link sent to the registered email.

Servers can be configured to use custom parameters. Therefore each Tape server might ask for different information or restrict registration based on the rules set by the server. If you are unsure how to register, please contact your server administrator.

## Choosing a username and display name

Your username is your unique identifier for others to use to direct message or mention you. Your username is separate to your display name on the server.

Usernames on each Tape server must be unique to that server. However, display names can repeat on the same server. For example, there can be only one user with the username `johndoe` but there can be more than one user with the display name `John Doe`.

# Sign in

To signin to a server [register](registration.md) an account manually or with a pre-configured OAuth service.

## Manual Log in

To manually log in, you must have used the [manual registration method](#sign-up-registering-an-account) or have set a `password` in your account settings.

You can log in using either your `username` or `email` and `password`.
